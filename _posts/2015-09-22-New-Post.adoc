*Apiman* is a API Management application that help you add policies to your service and set up and enforce contracts between service producers and consumers. 
*Fabric8* is cloud infrastructure build on Kubernetes and Docker. Fabric8 is fun to work with but Fabric8 is a fast moving train! If you want to be on it you need to hold on tight. In this post I list the minimal steps to get Apiman running on Fabric with the latest code. I'm assuming you have recent versions of Git, Java, Maven and Virtual Box installed your machine. If you do, then the following steps will get you up and running with Apiman on Fabric8 on Vagrant and OSX.
