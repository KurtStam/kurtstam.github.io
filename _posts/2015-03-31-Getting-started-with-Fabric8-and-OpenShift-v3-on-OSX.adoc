= Getting started with Fabric8 and OpenShift v3 on OSX
:hp-tags: OpenShift, Fabric8, OSX
:numbered:

The full fabric8 docs can be found http://fabric8.io/v2/openShiftDocker.html[here]. Here I took the relavant sections applicable to running on OSX, and I added some notes. OpenShift v3 relies on Docker for its container management. OSX does not support Docker natively. The http://fabric8.io/v2/openShiftDocker.html[recommended way] is to use vagrant to create a VM with the correct Docker configuration.

== Prerequisites

Install whatever the newest version is of the following:

* Docker Client - Just following the https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/[instructions for Docker on OSX], but know we will not be using Boot2Docker.
* Vagrant - Download the OSX version from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant] and install.
* VirtualBox - Download the OSX version from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] and install.


== Creating the fabric8 Virtual Machine

To create the VM on Virtual Box we simply use the https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/blob/master/Vagrantfile[Vagrantfile] in the root of the https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8[fabric8] root directory. Either download the https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/archive/master.zip[zip] of use git to get a clone of the repository
....
git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8.git
....

WARNING: The Vagrantfile is configured to build a VM with https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L32[4 VPUs  and 8192MB of Ram]. It is recommended to not exceed about half of your machine's resources. In my case that meant having to set this to 2 VPUs and 4096MB of Ram.

NOTE: Hopefully we can reduce the resource usage, we can bundle it up in a less resource intensive VM!

Now that we have updates the Vagrantfile with resonable settings for your machine we can create it using
....
vagrant up
....

This can take a bit depending on your network speed. Currently it builds Ubuntu-trusty-64 image, but hopefully it will build a Centos-7 image soon. Alternatively there are a few other linux distros at https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/master/support/vagrant[here]. I tried the Centos-7 distro but ran into an issue with Docker, so for now I'm staying with the Ubuntu image.

If you don't have the Vagrant Snapshot plugin installed yet run
....
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbox-snapshot
....
So that you can create a snapshot from the command line
....
vagrant snapshot take default cleanstart
....
Now you can revert to the current clean state at any time using
....
vagrant snapshot go default cleanstart
....


== Deploying Fabric8 onto the Virtual Machine

Now that you have a running VM it is time to install OpenShift and Fabric8. To make things easy everything you need is shipped in Docker containers.

[caption="Figure 2: "]
.Figure 2. Docker running inside the Fabric8 VM.


Simply log into the Fabric8 VM using
....
vagrant ssh
....
and then run the get-fabric8 script to install the minimal installation.
....
 bash <(curl -sSL https://bit.ly/get-fabric8) -fu -m 172.28.128.4
....
I'm using `-u` to update, `-f` to force a clean refresh of all the containers. This is needed because you actually already have the openshift container installed in the VM and we want to make sure we have the latest. The `-m` flag allows us to pass in the IP address of the SSO server. Optionally you can add `-P password123` to set a password - if you do not, *any* password will be valid.
The output of the script looks something like this:

Set these environment variables on your development machine:

export FABRIC8_CONSOLE=http://172.28.128.4
export DOCKER_REGISTRY=172.30.17.159:5000
export KUBERNETES_TRUST_CERT=true
export DOCKER_IP=172.28.128.4
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.28.128.4:2375
export KUBERNETES_MASTER=https://172.28.128.4:8443
....

Note that when it says: 'Waiting for' something it is looking for a docker container to get started. You should not need to wait longer then about a minute or so per container. Note that if something is wrong, it may sit there forever, and you should stop the script and try to rerun it, and seek help from one of us if that does not help.

The script ends with a final instruction to set 6 environment variables on your development machine. Please go ahead and copy and paste that fragment at the end of your .bash_profile on your development machine, and make sure they are set. Finally you will need to add some routes on your developement machine so you can access the IP addresses of services and pods hosted in your Virtual Machine (e.g. the Fabric8 Console), you'll need to add a network route for the 172.X.X.X IP range:
....
sudo route -n delete 172.0.0.0/8
sudo route -n add 172.0.0.0/8 $DOCKER_IP
....

Going back to the bash shell on the VM we can now get a list of all running containers by running
....
docker ps
....
You should see 11 containers:

== Fabric8 and the OpenShift Commandline (OSC)
To be able to connect to docker as well as your local registry running in the VM we need to add some routing to Docker. On Ubuntu locate the `/etc/default/docker` file and add the following options:
....
DOCKER_OPTS="-H unix://var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --insecure-registry 172.0.0.0/8"
....

now restart Docker using
....
restart docker
docker start openshift
....
Now on your development machine you can connect to Docker, and it is convenient to create the following alias (make sure to use the origin version *you* have installed)
....
alias osc="docker run --rm -i -e KUBERNETES_MASTER=https://$DOCKER_IP:8443 --entrypoint=osc --net=host openshift/origin:v0.4.3 --insecure-skip-tls-verify"
....
Now you can talk to Kubernetes and issue commands like
....
osc get pods
osc get services
....

If you see a nice list of services you are now ready to open the console.

== Fabric8 Console

On your developer machine you can now open your brower to http://172.28.128.4[http://172.28.128.4]

.Figure 3. The Fabric8/Origin Console.

and login using admin/<anypasswd>, and get a list of all the services that are running by default.

.Figure 4. Overview of all Services.

You can start a new App of Quickstart by navigating to the `Library` tab. Figure 5 shows a the list of apps. You can select and run any of the apps or quickstarts.

image:apps.png[]
[caption="Figure 5: "]
.Figure 5. Overview of Fabric8 applications you can run.

== Deploy a new app to your install
In my case I'm building the apiman-manager-api application, and to deploy it, I build it using the docker-build, and then I push it to my local docker registry:
....
mvn clean install docker-build
docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY:5000/fabric8/apiman-manager-api:2.2-SNAPSHOT
....
Then, to run it, drag and drop the `apiman-manager-api-2.2-SNAPSHOT-app.zip` onto the library tab of the console, right on top of the apps and quickstarts folders that should turn green when you dragging on onto it. By the way -for me- this works on Safari but not on Firefox. If successful a apiman-manager-api folwer should appear, and when entering into this app folder you can click the green run button.


== Conclusion
You now have a running Fabric8 installation on OSX and are  ready to explore its functionality. Look for more posts on this on this blog.

Cheers!
