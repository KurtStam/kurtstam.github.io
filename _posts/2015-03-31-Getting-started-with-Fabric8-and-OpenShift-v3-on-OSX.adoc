= Getting started with Fabric8 and OpenShift v3 on OSX
:hp-tags: OpenShift, Fabric8, OSX

OSX does not support Docker natively. The http://fabric8.io/v2/openShiftDocker.html[recommended way] is to use vagrant to create a VM with the right Docker configuration. Your machine will be called 

== Prerequisites
Before you get started you need to have the following tools installed:

* `Docker` client, go ahead and install the https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/[full Docker], but just know we will not be using `boot2docker` for this.
* `Vagrant` download from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[vagrantup.com].
* `VirtualBox` you can download from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[vitualbox.org]

Just grab the latest versions of whatever you can find.

== Build and start the Virtual Machine

To obtain the vagrantfile, download a repository https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/archive/master.zip[snapshot zip] or check out the Fabric8 Git Repo
....
git clone git@github.com:fabric8io/fabric8.git
....

You can use the default Vagrant file in the rout of the tree, or select one of other distributions in the `/support/vagrant` directory.
At the moment the default Vagrant file builds an Ubuntu VM.

WARNING: Before you start edit the Vagrantfile, and set the max memory and number of cpu's to about half of what your machine has, or else your machine might become *really* slow later.

With that taken care off lets bring up the VM running
....
vagrant up
....
It may take 10 minutes or so for this to finish depending on your download speed. In the end you will have a nice VM called 'fabric8_default' followed by some uuid.
