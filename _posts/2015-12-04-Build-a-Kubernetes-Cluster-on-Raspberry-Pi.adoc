= Build a Kubernetes Cluster on Raspberry Pi
:hp-tags: Kubernetes, RaspberryPi
:numbered:


== Required hardware

To build this 4 Pi setup I used 

* 4 Raspberry Pi 2 with a quad core CPU and 1 GB of RAM
* 4 16 GB MicroSD cards - class 10
* 1 60 W power supply with USB outlets
* 4 short USB to Micro USB cables for powering the Pi's
* 4 short cat 5 network cables
* 1 longer cat 5 network cable to hook into your network
* 1 network hub (mine is an old 5 port 10/100 Mbs I dusted off)
* Lego's from your childhood. Just get creative. Trust me it feels good to build your own!

It is important to get class 10 MicroSD cards as this is the one component that affects the speed of the system greatly. You can easily get away with a smaller 20W powersupply for 4 Pi's, I'm planning on adding more Pi's later so I got a bigger one.) The network port on the Pi is 100 Mbs, so you can use your old hub.

== Flashing the MicroSD cards

The first thing we need to do now is to get the operating system onto the MicroSD Cards. I'm using an Hypriot image. I did test a bunch of different images [1] including Pidora, Redsleeve/Centos7, ArchLinux, but concluded that Hypriot is the best for me at this point. Mostly because of the native Docker support and the image being small. You can download the latest hypriot image from [2].  The following instructions are OSX specific. 

1. Insert the memory card in the card reader.
2. Unmount the card (using the du utility)
3. sudo dd bs=1m if=hypriot-rpi-20151103-224349.img of=/dev/disk2
4. wait .. this may take 10 minutes or so.

Do this for all 4 MicroSD cards. You can work on your lego casing while waiting.


== Power up and add DNS

You can now power up the first Pi. By default to login use root/hypriot. You will need to set up DNS for each of the Pi's. If you don't want to hook up a monitor and keyboard to login at the console to figure out its IP and Mac address, then you can use nmap [3] to figure this out. If you have a DNS service provision it there, or else name the Pi's in /etc/hosts. I named my Pi's _rpi-master_, _rpi-node-1_, _rpi-node-2_ and _rpi-node-3_. With a quick reboot of each Pi you will see the names reflected at the cmd prompt. Note that if you skip the DNS step your Kubernetes cluster will not work. I added the following to my _/etc/hosts_ files on all machines
....
192.168.1.9     rpi-master
192.168.1.21    rpi-node-1
192.168.1.18    rpi-node-2
192.168.1.23    rpi-node-3
....


== Add Swap (optional)

I added 1Gb of swap space to my _rpi-master_ because it runs a few more Kubernetes components. Some people seem concerned that frequent writes to the MicroSD card will make it fail quickly. I therefore decided to set the 'swappiness' such that it only uses the swap as a last resort.
....
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap/swapfile bs=1M count=1024
    mkswap /swap/swapfile
    swapon /swap/swapfile
....
Now you can check with 'top' that you have a 1 GB of swapspace
....
KiB Mem:    947468 total,   913096 used,    34372 free,    69884 buffers
KiB Swap:  1048572 total,      484 used,  1048088 free,   667248 cached
....
To make the swap permanent between reboots add
....
/swap/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
....
to you _/etc/fstab_ file. Finally in the _/etc/sysctl.conf_ I've set the swappiness to 1 to make it not very 'swappy'
....
vm.swappiness = 1
....
'1' means it will only use swap when the RAM use gets over 99%.


== Intall Kubernetes

These instructions are to install the plain vanilla Kubernetes from Google. I had some issues compiling Openshift v3 due to some 64 bit dependencies, and I will get back to that later. I would like go support both. All the code that I'm using is checked in under https://github.com/Project31. If you want to compile your own Kubernetes binaries then visit [4].


=== Install Kubernetes Master

The Kubernetes master runs the kubernetes REST API, a scheduler, kubernetes-proxy, a replication controller, and it uses etcd as a key-value store that is replicated with between other Kubernetes masters. For more details please see the Kubernetes documentation at [5].

.Kubernetes master components.

To install these components onto the master, login to the master node and run
....
    git clone git@github.com:Project31/kubernetes-installer-rpi.git
    cd kubernetes-install-rpi
    ./build-master.sh
....

Verify the running docker containers using _docker ps_
....
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

026c19a67f86        hyperkube                                         "/hyperkube scheduler"   3 days ago          Up 3 days                               k8s_kube-scheduler.9eefe01e_kube-controller-rpi-master_default_2d7688bceff12d2c89bf40c848f6e4dd_1dd7c2e9

a737d9927c03        hyperkube                                         "/hyperkube apiserver"   3 days ago          Up 3 days                               k8s_kube-apiserver.41110286_kube-controller-rpi-master_default_2d7688bceff12d2c89bf40c848f6e4dd_9ce28f62

....
and the now set _export KUBERNETES_MASTER=http://rpi-master:8080_ so your _kubectl_ can connect the kubernetes REST API on the master. Now let take a look at the running pods using _kubectl get pods_
....
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-controller-rpi-master   5/5       Running   0         10s
....

We can see that the _kube-controller-rpi-master_ pod contains runs 5 docker containers with the Kubernetes services mentioned above.


=== Install Kubernetes Node

The Kubernetes node only run the kubernetes proxy and the pods. 

image::kubernetes-node.png[]

.Kubernetes client components.

To install these components on a node, login to the node and run
....
    git clone git@github.com:Project31/kubernetes-installer-rpi.git
    cd kubernetes-install-rpi
....
Now edit the kube-procy.yaml and set "--master=http://rpi-master:8080" to your kubernetes master.
Then edit the _kubelet.service_ file and set your master's Kubernetes REST endpoint there as well. (which in my case is _http://192.168.1.9:8080_).

Now you can run the install
....
    ./build-worker.sh
....

and verify our proxy came up using _docker ps_
....
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS            NAMES
cf4a9a2d7f35        hyperkube    "/hyperkube proxy --m"   40 seconds ago      Up 37 seconds                        k8s_kube-proxy...
d9f8f937df4d        gcr.io/go... "/pause"                 43 seconds ago      Up 40 seconds                        k8s_POD.e4cc..
....
The proxy is running! Set _export KUBERNETES_MASTER=http://rpi-master:8080_ so your _kubectl_ can connect the kubernetes REST API on the master. Now  verify the nodes are all registered
....
kubectl get nodes
NAME         LABELS                              STATUS
rpi-master   kubernetes.io/hostname=rpi-master   Ready
rpi-node-1   kubernetes.io/hostname=rpi-node-1   Ready
rpi-node-2   kubernetes.io/hostname=rpi-node-2   Ready
rpi-node-3   kubernetes.io/hostname=rpi-node-3   Ready
....

Yay it worked!

=== Open Docker for remote connections.

Finally, on the master we need to fix up the Docker configuration so it accepts remote connections, so we can deploy something to it. Open the _/etc/default/docker_ file for editing and set the DOCKER_OPTS
....
	DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://192.168.1.9:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --storage-driver=overlay -D"
....
where the IP address of machine, or you can user '0.0.0.0' to bind to all interfaces. Now we can remotely push docker images to the master. In my next post I'm going to deploy a fabric8, note that the docker images you want to run need to be based on an ARM architecture or else they won't run!

=== Deploy a simple service

Let's deploy a simply service, and scale to two pods to make sure things are working correctly
....

kubectl -s http://localhost:8080 run httpd --image=hypriot/rpi-busybox-httpd --port=80
kubectl scale --replicas=2 rc httpd
kubectl get pods -o wide
....
We see that eventhough we executed the command on the master is started a pod on node-2 and node-3.

NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       NODE
httpd-4v1qw                  1/1       Running   0          9m        rpi-node-2
httpd-qxcxu                  0/1       Pending   0          16s       rpi-node-3
kube-controller-rpi-master   5/5       Running   0          1d        rpi-master
kube-system-rpi-node-1       1/1       Running   0          33m       rpi-node-1
kube-system-rpi-node-2       1/1       Running   0          43m       rpi-node-2
kube-system-rpi-node-3       1/1       Running   0          53m       rpi-node-3

That's it for now. In the next blog post I will talk about deploying fabric8 services.
