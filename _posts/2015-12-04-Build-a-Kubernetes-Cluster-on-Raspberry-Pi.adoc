= Build a Kubernetes Cluster on Raspberry Pi
:hp-tags: Kubernetes, RaspberryPi

== Required hardware

To build this 4 Pi setup I used 

* 4 Raspberry Pi 2 with a quad core CPU and 1 GB of RAM
* 4 16 GB Micro SD cards - class 10
* 1 60 W power supply with USB outlets
* 4 short USB to Micro USB cables for powering the Pi's
* 4 short cat 5 network cables
* 1 longer cat 5 network cable to hook into your network
* 1 network hub (mine is an old 5 port 10/100 Mbs I dusted off)
* Lego's from your childhood. Just get creative. Trust me it feels good to build your own!

It is important to get class 10 MicroSD cards as this is the one component that affects the speed of the system greatly. You can easily get away with a smaller 20W powersupply for 4 Pi's, I'm planning on adding more Pi's later so I got a bigger one.)
